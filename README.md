### About the project
-Flight Price, is a dataset from kaggle, where we are given different features like Airline, Source, Destination etc.. and we have to train
the ML models on these features and predict the Price of the Flight.

### About the V2
-v2 is the version 2.0 for the project, which covers the following limitations, that were there in the v1(earlier version)

limitatiions (of v1) : 
1. poor file structuring
2. messy code, often violating the DRY(don't repeat youself) principle of the prgramming
3. broken pipelines and scalers
4. no proper documentation
5. data often being mixed
6. lack of proper reporting techinques(like use of Power BI, tableu etc..)

- so, I finally came to the conclsuion to make the V2 of the project, where my main target will be to eliminate all those limitation
and make the project more upto date as per the industry standards.

Advantages of v2 : 
1. Proper structuring of files
2. Maintained documentation
3. (.gitignore) file to tackle all of test code
4. Managable code with propoer modular structure
