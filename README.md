# Flight-Price-EDA
I am solving flight price dataset in this repo, by using the FE(Featured Engineering) &amp; EDA(Exploratory data analysis).

### day 1 update
 -load the dataset and simplified the approach by dropping the pricee column for FE and EDA process
 -handled Airline and the route column

 ### day 2 update

 -handled rest of the columns that included additonal_info, no of stops, date of journey, arrival time, dep time, duration, soruce, destination
 -now the dataset is clean with no categorical column/null value

 ### day 3 update

 - saved the data files, made qq plot for the source, destination, no of stops columns
 - made another file and setup the data for the testing algorithms 

 ### day 4 update 

 -made the predictions on the dataset(X_test) using the following algorithms :
 - Linear rgeression, SVM regression, KNN regression, Decision Tree regression, Random forest regressor, Ada boost regressor, Gradient boost regressor

 - prepared report(part 1 basics, only)

 ### day 5 update

 -made the complete report with the test data,
 - started hitting on the eval data, reporting and predicstions pending yet alongside the outliers part
