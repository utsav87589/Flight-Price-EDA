# Flight-Price-EDA
I am solving flight price dataset in this repo, by using the FE(Featured Engineering) &amp; EDA(Exploratory data analysis).

### day 1 update
 -load the dataset and simplified the approach by dropping the pricee column for FE and EDA process
 -handled Airline and the route column

 ### day 2 update

 -handled rest of the columns that included additonal_info, no of stops, date of journey, arrival time, dep time, duration, soruce, destination
 -now the dataset is clean with no categorical column/null value
