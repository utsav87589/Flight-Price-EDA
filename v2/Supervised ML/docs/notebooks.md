### ------------ Folder name : notebooks --------------------

- here is all the information about the 'notebooks' folder including the files and the operation each individual file/subfolder is responsible for, alongside the folder structure.

- in this folder, we have all the jupyter notebbok code, that was used alongisde the 'src' file in order to complete our project.

- so far**, we have 3 files in the notbooks folder, 


********************file : basics.ipynb*******************

- in this file, we just loaded the data, performed some primary checks like the nan, duplicates and the strategy for the feature engineering steps,
we also changed the name of the files from 'Data_Train.xlsx' to 'train.csv' and 'Test_set.xlsx' to 'valid.csv'.


********************file : process_train.ipynb*******************

- in this file, we processed the entire train data, applied the feature engineering logic and made the model ready data : (train_distance.csv and train_trees.csv)


********************file : process_train.ipynb*******************

- in this file, we processed the entire valid data, applied the feature engineering logic and made the model ready data : (valid_distance.csv and valid_trees.csv)



** the number of files keep changing as the project moves forward, in certain refinement, the files are either added or removed alongisde the similar ananlogy with the logic inside the files

** for the feature engineering logic, check either the (flowchart) or the (feature_engineering.md) file in the (docs).
