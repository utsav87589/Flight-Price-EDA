### ------------ Folder name : labels --------------------

- here is all the information about the 'labels' folder including the files and the operation each individual file/subfolder is responsible for, alongside the folder structure.
- labels folder is basically where all the saved labels are, that were saved during the clustering phase for the training data of both scaled and non scaled data, the idea was to save those labels to later recall and to put in on a comparison with the price column in the respective data classes.
- further this folder is divided into two subfolders : 1. Scaled, 2. Non_scaled labels.

##### Subfolder : Scaled
- In the scaled subfolder, we have the labels that were generated after applying the clustering algorithms on the scaled train data, further we have : 
1. scaled_kmeans_labels : labels generated by kmeans clustering on the scaled train data, after finding the value for the k earlier using the wcss score and elbow curve
2. scaled_dbscan_labels : labels generated by db_scan clustering on the scaled train data, after finding the value of the eps earlier using the distance plot
3. scaled_hm_labels : labels generated by the HM clustering i.e. Agglomerative clutsering, after finding the value of the n_clusters using the dendogram. for the hm clustering, the sample size of the data was reduced from 10k to 3k due to the lack of the resources.


##### Subfolder : Non_scaled
