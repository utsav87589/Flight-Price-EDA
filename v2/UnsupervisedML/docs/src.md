### ------------ Folder name : src --------------------

- here is all the information about the src folder including the files and the operation each individual file/subfolder is responsible for, alongside the folder structure.
- src folder is the one containing the python code mostly in form of function that was later reused again and again in the notebook files, before completing the report part.
- this folder structure is bit more complex with many subfolders inside and functions inside of the files in those subfolders, but here I try to give the best explanantion I could give, to guide you through the folder.
