- these notebooks files have the exact process alongside giving the hint, how the operations were being carried out combined with the files in the src folder.


##### File : process_data.ipynb
- in this file conatins the code, logic and implementation of how the data went from intermidiate to the model ready, obvisouly, you can refer to the exact file to find the more information about it, the comments are out there in the file, you can also refer to the flowchart for the project to get the hint, as it is not possible to put the exact line by line logic here, but still I am adding the flow of the file which explains the enough to know about the file.
