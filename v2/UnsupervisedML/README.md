# Flight-Price-EDA : Unsupervised ML
- Here is all about the unsupervised ml part for the Flight price EDA project. In the unsupervised ML part, I took the same data that I had for the tree and distance based models (i.e, scaled and non scaled data) and then proceeded with it.
- although some functions that are in the src file are exactl same, but instead of importing from the supervised ml file, I prefered to make new ones fo the unsupervsied ml files to avoid the confusion and the problematic part for the furture.
