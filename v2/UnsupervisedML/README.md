# Flight-Price-EDA : Unsupervised ML
- Here is all about the unsupervised ml part for the Flight price EDA project. In the unsupervised ML part, I took the same data that I had for the tree and distance based models (i.e, scaled and non scaled data) and then proceeded with it.
- although some functions that are in the src file are exactl same, but instead of importing from the supervised ml file, I prefered to make new ones fo the unsupervsied ml files to avoid the confusion and the problematic part for the furture.


### ---------- brief summary : folder structure -------------
- Below is a brief discription about what each folder might contain inside, and what can you actually expect. for more detailed information, I have secific readme file for the each folder, within the folder named (docs)

1. Data : This folder contains all the data used for the unsupervised ML in both form (intermidiate)
2. docs : Has all the readme files
3. notebooks : contains all the notebook files (jupyter files)
4. reports : Reports done at the end of the project
5. src : has all the reusable code and functions that were called in the notebooks
